##Table Tennis App

We’re still very much in the early stages of development, but are onto something awesome.  We are building a table tennis score / gametracker and are doing this to hone in on our development, design and product skills.   Our vision is to create an open source playground, for future developers in training to grow and experiment with us. Although, our core team for the time being is made up of some of CodeClan’s most curious students.
